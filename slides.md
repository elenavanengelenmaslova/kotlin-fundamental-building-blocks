# Variables

---
transition: fade-out

level: 3
---

# Mutable Variables

<v-clicks>

- Defined using the `var` keyword

- Value can be changed after initial assignment

- Useful when the value needs to be updated based on program logic or user input

- Considerations 
  - Mutable variables should be used judiciously 
  - Excessive use can make code harder to reason about 
  - Best practice: Use `val` when the variable's value does not need to change.

</v-clicks>


---
---

# Mutable variables - RaceCar Example

A public `lapTimes` array is updated using `addLapTime` function after each lap, `currentLap` that holds current lap number and `isPitStopNeeded` and a `currentSpeed` which are updated as needed.

```kotlin {all|4-6,9|4-6,9|9,11-13}
class RaceCar(
  val carNumber: Int,
  val maxSpeed: Double = Random.nextDouble(200.0, 230.0),
  private var currentSpeed: Double = 0.0,
  internal var currentLap: Int = 0,
  internal var isPitStopNeeded: Boolean = false,
  numLaps: Int,
) {
  var lapTimes = arrayOfNulls<Double>(numLaps)
     private set
  
  fun addLapTime(lapNumber: Int, time: Double) {
    lapTimes[lapNumber] = time
  }
}

```

---
---

# Mutable variables - Driver Example

Mutable `points` is updated after each race (if applicable) using `addPoints` function.

```kotlin {all|3|3,6-8}
class Driver(
    val name: String,
    var points: Int = 0,
    val uuid: UUID = UUID.randomUUID() // unique identifier
) {
    fun addPoints(newPoints: Int) {
        points += newPoints
    }
}

```

# Immutable Variables

<v-clicks>

- Defined using the `val` keyword

- Value cannot be changed after initial assignment - it is read-only

- Useful when the value does not change after initial assignment

- Enhances code readability and safety

</v-clicks>

---
---

# Immutable Variables - Driver Example

The properties `name` and `uuid` and `isPitStopNeeded` do not change after Driver instance is created.

```kotlin {all|2,4}
class Driver(
    val name: String,
    var points: Int = 0,
    val uuid: UUID = UUID.randomUUID() // unique identifier
) {
    fun addPoints(newPoints: Int) {
        points += newPoints
    }
}

```

# Variable Scope and Lifetime
Variable 'scope' and 'lifetime' are essential aspects to understand for efficient variable management.

<v-clicks>


- Scope defines the code region where a variable is accessible.

- Local Variables

- Member Variables

- Top-level Variables

- Lifetime of a variable extends from its declaration point until its scope's termination.

</v-clicks>

<!--
- Local Variables: Declared inside a block of code (like a function). Accessible only within the block they were declared. Lifetime extends until the end of the block.
- Member Variables: Declared inside a class (but not inside a method). By default, they are public and can be accessed where the class object is accessible. Lifetime extends for the duration of the object of the class.
- Top-level Variables: Declared outside any class or function. By default, they are public and can be accessed from any part of your program.

-->

---
---

# Variable Scope Example
Can you identify local, member, and top level variables?

```kotlin {all|9,13|9,11|13-15|5-8,11|1}
var currentWeather: String = "Sunny"

class RaceCar(
    val carNumber: Int,
    val maxSpeed: Double = Random.nextDouble(200.0, 230.0),
    private var currentSpeed: Double = 0.0,
    internal var currentLap: Int = 0,
    internal var isPitStopNeeded: Boolean = false,
    numLaps: Int,
) {
    var lapTimes = arrayOfNulls<Double>(numLaps)

    fun addLapTime(lapNumber: Int, time: Double) {
        lapTimes[lapNumber] = time
    }
}
```

<!--

- Properties  `numLaps`, `lapNumber` and `time` are **local variables**
- Properties `carNumber`, `maxSpeed`, `currentSpeed`, `currentLap`, `isPitStopNeeded` and `lapTimes` are **member variables**. The property 
- `currentWeather` is a **top level variable**.

# Constants

---
transition: fade-out

level: 3
---
# Understanding and Declaring Constants

Constants are immutable values, determined at compile-time, that remain unchanged throughout program execution.

<v-clicks>

- Constants can be declared as top-level or within a companion object utilizing the `const` keyword with `val`
  
- Constants are public by default and their types can be inferred by the Kotlin compiler

- Constants serve various purposes such as:
  - Providing stable configuration settings
  - Representing mathematical constants
  - Denoting unchanging parameters in an application, like F1 Race rules


</v-clicks>

# Restrictions and Benefits of Constants

<v-clicks>

- Constants are limited to primitive types and Strings in Kotlin.

- Non-changing, complex objects that are not of primitive types or Strings can be declared as read-only properties using val.

- Constants improve application performance due to compile-time optimization.

- Code maintenance becomes easier as constants help avoid hard-coded values and reduce potential errors.

- Constants can be used alongside other constants in expressions, computed at compile time.

</v-clicks>

# Constants Example
Can you think of any Formula one rules that could be a constant?

```kotlin {all|1,2,10-12}
const val MAX_TEAMS = 10
const val MAX_LAPS = 5

class Race(
    val numberOfLaps: Int,
    val teams: List<Team>,
    var currentLap: Int = 0,
) {
    // ...
    companion object {
        const val PITSTOP_TIME = 5.0 // 5 minutes
    }
}
```

<!--

- Constants  `MAX_TEAMS`, `MAX_LAPS` are top-level constants
- Constant `PITSTOP_TIME` is a class level constant defined within a companion object
